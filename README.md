In this repository have created two forms, one using useState and another using React hook form. 
The two forms have different ways of implementing form functionalities and this is the purpose of this repoðŸ˜Ž

##Zod
Zod is a TypeScript-first schema validation library designed to help developers define, validate, and manipulate data structures with ease. By leveraging TypeScript's static type system, Zod ensures early error detection and provides increased confidence in the correctness of your code1. It offers a fluent API for creating schemas, validating data, and transforming validated data into desired formats. Zod is ideal for building robust and reliable applications with strong type safety.
I have added a form utilizing zod functionalities and it Zod is proving to be great for validating input for both client side and server side.
